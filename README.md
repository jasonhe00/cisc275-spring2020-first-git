1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

2. What five objects are created in the main?

In the main, the 5 objects added are:
List<Dog> 
3 Dogs
Comparator<Animal>


3. Can you spot the Comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the Comparator?

The Comparator directly overrides the compare method without directly creating a class for it. The first call of Comparator is followed by the overriding of the compare function to work with Animals.
